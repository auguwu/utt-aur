# ðŸ§© utt-aur
> *Unofficial AUR package for [queer/utt](https://github.com/queer/utt), a universal text transformer.*

Read the original repository's [README](https://github.com/queer/utt) on what **utt** is.

## Installation
```sh
yay -S utt-bin # Downloads a binary from the GitHub Releases page
```

This project does build **utt** from [source](https://github.com/queer/utt), but only produces the binary that you will run. It is this way so it doesn't take a whole lot of time extracting the JAR file that `makepkg` does.

## License
**utt-aur** doesn't have a LICENSE attached to the repository, so you're free to fork and make your own adjustments as you wish.
